# Lowest Rated Parking Lots

This is an application that, depending on the city you are looking for, will show you the parking spaces that are available ordered in ascending order by rating.
The Yelp Fusion API was used to develop the application.
In the future I would like to make it responsive.

## Instructions

You will need to create an .env file in which you must code:

    REACT_APP_APIKEY=<your_yelp_apikey>

You can get the apikey in the following link

[Yelp Fusion](https://www.yelp.com/fusion)

To initialize the React application

    npm install / yarn
    npm start / yarn start

## Technologies

-   JavaScript
-   React
-   CSS modules
-   Yelp Fusion API

## DEMO

I have deployed the app in Vercel. [DEMO](https://lowest-rated-parking.vercel.app/)
